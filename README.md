# Sentiment-Analysis
Utilized pre-trained BERT for feature extraction to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of about 100,000 tweets.
Used BERTâ€™s Tokenizer, for tokenizing the sentences which are then fed into the BERT model for extracting features.
Used Mathews Correlation Coefficient for evaluation of the binary classification task. 
Performance of the model was improved using Linear Warm-Up Learning Rate Scheduler as compared to the default learning rate scheduler
